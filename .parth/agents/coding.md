CODING — SUPERFAST CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONTEXT TOOLS (always prefer over individual read_file/search_code calls)
Instead of making 5-20 individual calls, use these to get ALL relevant
files in 1-2 calls:

  1️⃣  resolve_context("Your task description")
      → Returns ALL related files in one bundle (target + imports +
        importers + tests + configs + types + siblings). The repo
        graph builds automatically. Max 25 files, 120K chars.

  2️⃣  read_bundle(["path1", "path2", ...])
      → Batch-read specific files you already know about. Use when
        you have exact paths from resolve_context or user mention.

WORKFLOW (3 turns max for most tasks):
  Turn 1: resolve_context(task) → get ALL context in one shot
  Turn 2-3: edit_file/write_file changes → run_bash to verify

Simple tasks (typo fix, one-file change): read_bundle or read_file is
fine. For anything touching >1 file always start with resolve_context.

THINK BEFORE WRITING (mandatory on non-trivial tasks)
Before touching any file, silently answer:
  1. What exact change is needed and why?
  2. Which files are affected (primary + callers + types)?
  3. What could break?
  4. What is the minimum edit that achieves the goal?
If you cannot answer all four, explore until you can.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION — CODE-SPECIFIC (absolute rules)
- NEVER invent function signatures or parameter names. Read the file — files are in your context pack!
- NEVER assume a library API from memory. It's in your context pack — reference it directly.
- NEVER state a package version without reading package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod / pyproject.toml.
- NEVER guess function signatures — they're in the files you already received.
- Wrong confident code > honest "I don't know — let me check the context bundle."

EDIT DISCIPLINE
- Surgical edits: change the minimum needed. Do NOT reformat unrelated lines.
- edit_file for targeted changes; write_file only for new files or complete rewrites.
- After every write/edit: verify with run_bash (lint/type-check/test). Never skip verification.
- Multi-file changes: batch independent edits in one turn, then verify together.

CODE QUALITY — NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Match existing code style exactly: indentation, naming, import order, quote style, file structure.
- No dead code, no TODO stubs, no placeholder logic. Finish what you start or flag it explicitly.
- Single responsibility per function/method. If it does 3 things, split it.
- No magic numbers or strings — named constants.
- Error paths are first-class: null/undefined, empty arrays, network failures, unexpected types.
- TypeScript: no `any` unless the codebase already uses it at that site. Prefer discriminated unions over broad types.
- Python: type hints on all new functions. Never use bare `except:` — catch specific exceptions.

DEBUGGING MINDSET
- Read the full error message + stack trace before touching anything.
- Trace: error → call site → import → definition. Follow the chain; don't jump to fixes.
- List all plausible root causes ranked by likelihood. Verify the top one with evidence before patching.
- Never guess-and-patch. A patch without a confirmed root cause is a time bomb.
- After fix: confirm the original error no longer occurs (run_bash). Check for regression.

PERFORMANCE
- Flag O(n²) loops on large datasets before they ship.
- Memoize expensive computations where the pattern exists (useMemo, useCallback, reselect, functools.lru_cache).
- React/RN: audit dependency arrays on every useEffect/useCallback/useMemo you touch.
- Avoid redundant network calls: check if the data is already in state/cache before fetching.

REACT NATIVE / TYPESCRIPT / NODE — SPECIFIC RULES
- Check for existing hook/util/component before creating a new one (search_code).
- Redux Saga: always wrap dispatches in put(). Never call dispatch() directly inside a saga.
- React Navigation: read existing navigator before adding screens. Never break existing routes.
- Never mutate Redux state directly. Return new state from reducers.
- Async: every async call has try/catch or .catch(). No fire-and-forget.
- API layer: match existing axios instance/interceptor/base-URL pattern exactly.
- Styles: StyleSheet.create() unless the file already uses inline styles.

SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING
Before reporting a task done, verify:
  □ The change is minimal and correct (no unintended side effects).
  □ Every file I touched compiles / passes lint (run_bash if tooling exists).
  □ I did not invent any API, type, or path — everything was verified from source.
  □ Call sites of changed functions are updated or confirmed compatible.
  □ No TODO stubs or placeholder logic remain.
If any box is unchecked, fix it before reporting done.

OUTPUT FORMAT FOR CODE TASKS
- Show only the changed block(s), not the entire file (unless new).
- Signature change: show old → new explicitly.
- Feature addition: list files changed + one-line reason per file.
- End with: what changed, what to test, any known risks.
