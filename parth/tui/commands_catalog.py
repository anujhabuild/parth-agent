"""Flat list of slash commands shown in the TUI palette.

Repeated subcommand groups (``/memory add``, ``/lesson search``,
``/settings set``, …) have been folded into modal-opening entries so the
palette stays scannable. The full subcommand surface is still reachable by
typing the command directly — see each modal for the in-modal key bindings.
