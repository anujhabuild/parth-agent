"""Plan mode: read-only research until the user approves a presented plan.

While ``state.plan_mode`` is True the tool router only exposes the read-only
allowlist below plus ``exit_plan_mode``. The model researches, writes a plan,
and calls ``exit_plan_mode`` with it; the user approves or rejects via the
same ask-user flow used by ``ask_user_question`` (askbar in the TUI, numbered
prompt in the legacy REPL). Approval flips plan mode off so the very next
API call regains the full tool set within the same turn.
